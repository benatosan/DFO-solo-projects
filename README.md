This is a collection of the projects completed by Evan James alone during the 8 month co-op term at DFO.
Note that the OrthoTides and Means and Extremes scripts will not work due to API endpoints and secrets being removed for security reasons.

The majority of the coding work during this co-op was focused on "GapFill" which is a script that detects water level data gaps and communicates with water level stations to fill them retroactively.
I successfully created logic to find station metadata through online endpoints instead of XML, as well as logic to use a modem connection to the stations instead of IP for a backup alternative. 
By the end of my workterm we were working on fully automating the script through a scheduler on a collaborative work space.
This work cannot be shown here because of security but feel free to contact me for any questions regarding this work.
